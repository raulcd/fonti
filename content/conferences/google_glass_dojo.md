Title: London Google Glass Dojo 
Date: 2014-07-19 18:30
Summary: Google invites some developers to do some coding over the weekend for the Google Glass.

Dojos, meetups, sprints are good ways to improve development skills 
and to get in touch with companies and colleagues.

Google helds in London several events for the developer community. On the last 
months Google has launched the [Mirror API](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/mirror/index).

Basically there are two ways to code for the google glass. Create applications 
that runs on the Glass device itself or use the Mirror API. The applications 
that runs on the Glass are created using the Glass Development Kit ([GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk)), and basically is an extension to the 
Android Development Kit.

The Mirror API let developers create applications that post content to the 
user Glass device via web. The user needs to log in with their 
google account to the web application. Once they are logged in the content 
being published in the user timeline is shown in the Glass Device. The advantages 
are that you don´t need to have prior experience (only need to call google APIs) 
to code for the Google Glass Device.

## Setting the demo environment

In order to start first of all you need to create an account for your application 
on google APIs.

```console  
$ pip install pelican
```
